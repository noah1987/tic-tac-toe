# Tic Tac Toe
## About this projecrt
The Goal of WDI 30 Project 0 was to build a Tic Tac Toe game from scratch. I've used what I've learned about HTML, CSS, Javascript & jQuery in creating the game.

## Live Demo

## Highlight of the project
### Adaptive game board size
You can choose game board size from 3 to 9. It will render the game board perfectly without a glitch.

### Home brew algorithm
There is an existing algorithm on the Internet called 'Minimax', which is unbeatable and kills the fun of playing the game.
So I decided to write my own algorithm. The result is a smart yet not unbeatable AI.
